      <p>This policy describes the cancellation and refund terms for services provided by Design Department Partners LLC ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

      <h2>Cancellation by Client</h2>
      <p>You may cancel a service engagement at any time by providing written notice to us at <a href="mailto:hellogodesigndepartment@gmail.com">hellogodesigndepartment@gmail.com</a>. Cancellations are effective upon our written acknowledgment.</p>

      <h2>Work Completed Prior to Cancellation</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for payment of all work completed up to the date of cancellation. This includes any hours worked, deliverables produced, or third-party costs incurred on your behalf prior to the cancellation date.</p>

      <h2>Deposits and Retainers</h2>
      <p>Deposits and retainer payments are generally non-refundable, as they are used to reserve time and resources on your behalf. Any exceptions will be specified in your individual service agreement.</p>

      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>Refunds for work not yet performed may be issued at our discretion, less any applicable administrative or processing costs. Requests for refunds must be submitted in writing within 30 days of the original payment date.</p>

      <h2>Cancellation by Design Department Partners LLC</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to cancel a service engagement at any time if a client violates our Terms of Service, fails to make payment, or for any other reason we deem necessary. In such cases, we will provide a prorated refund for any prepaid work not yet completed.</p>

      <h2>SMS Opt-Out</h2>
      <p>To cancel SMS messages from us at any time, reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any message. This does not affect your service engagement or any payment obligations. See our <a href="/sms-consent.html">SMS Consent &amp; Messaging Terms</a> for full details
